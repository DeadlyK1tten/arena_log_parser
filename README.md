MTG Arena Log Parser

Python MTG Arena log parser.

Use at own risk; no warranty of any kind provided.

NOTE: Mulligans not being tracked at present. Will be fixed "sometime"

Since all the code does is read some text files and writes other ones, you really would need to
take a lot of effort to break things.

See "process_log.py" for instructions...

Initial test described in aggregate30.py
